## 🏆 Project Highlights  

Welcome to **Gallery App**, a future Android application currently in the design phase using **Figma**. This project showcases my expertise in graphic design and UI/UX principles, focusing on creating a clean, modern, and intuitive photo management experience. The design emphasizes smooth interactions, thoughtful navigation, and visual appeal that will seamlessly translate into a native Android application. While the Kotlin implementation is planned for future development, the current design work demonstrates my ability to create user-friendly mobile experiences that prioritize both aesthetics and functionality. 📱🎨
